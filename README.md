# The intergalactic reserve

The intergalactic reserve is a cosmos SDK blockchain built to create a viable digital decentralized currency for stable payments.
The main goal of the project is to create a truly trustless decentralized stable currency fully backed by digital assets.

## As decentralized as possible

- No central company controlling the network. 
- All protocol changes decided by de validators and the community.
- Completely open source and public. If you have any suggestion feel free to share it or make a pull request.

## How it works

- The blockchain issues stable credits in a debt like manner
- Each user can deposit assets and get the equivalent amount in stable credits
- Credits are fully backed and overcollateralized. There can't be more credits than collateral.
- Stable borrowing fee instead of long term debt.

# Other capabilities

- Trustless OTC transactions
